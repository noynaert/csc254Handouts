# 07.070 String Comparisons

## `equals(String other)`

In Java, the the variable holds the ***address*** where the item is stored.

So if you do ("first" == name) it is actually comparing the addresses where first and name are stored.

Use equals.  It returns a boolean.

```java
    if(answer.equals("None"))
    if(answer.equalsIgnoreCase("None"))
```

#### Do not code like this

```java
    if(answer.equals("None") == true)
    if(answer.equalsIgnoreCase("None") == true)
```


You can do "not equals" with the "not" operator `!`

```java
    if(!answer.equals("None"))
    if(!answer.equalsIgnoreCase("None"))
```

## `compareTo(String other)` and `compareToIgnoreCase(String other)`

compareTo is one of the most important string functions.  

```java
   int result = word.compareTo("Target")
   int result = word.compareToIgnoreCase("Target")
```

The integer that is returned is

```java
   if(a.compareTo(b) < 0)
   if(a.compareTo(b) == 0)
   if(a.compareTo(b) > 0)
```

    * less than 0 if `a` would alphabetize before `b`
    * equals 0 if `a` and `b` are identical strings
    * greater than 0 if `a` would alphabetize greater than `b`

The unicode values are what is actually being compared.  So I think of the response as if integers were being subtracted.

* 2 - 3  would give a negative result
* 2 - 2  would give a zero
* 3 - 2  would give a positive resu
