Data types like `int`, `double`, `boolean`, and `char` are all ***primitive*** data types.

# The String API

The String API is important.

When looking at the methods, you usually need to look carefully at the return type.

## Calling String methods

String methods are generally called by putting the variable name, a period, and then the method name.

## `length()`

Returns an integer.  

The empty string returns a length of 0.

## `charAt(int index)`

Index starts as zero.

## format("", ...)

String.format works like a printf statement.It allows you the power of string formatting that you would get with printf, but used as a String.

```Java
String sentence;
sentence = String.format("The square root of %f is %4.1f", number, Math.sqrt(number));
```
