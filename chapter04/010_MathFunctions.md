# Math Methods

## Methods vs Functions

This chapter is about calling functions, not writing them.

I am assuming people in this class have had experience with functions and function calls.  Python functions are an example of functions

A ***method*** is a function that is part of a class.  In Java, functions may only be placed inside of classes.  So in Java, all functions are methods.

The Math API is at [https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Math.html)

## Arguments vs Parameters

The terms *Argument* and *Parameter* are often confusing to students.  The two terms are related.

* Arguments are what goes inside the parenthesis when you *call* a function
* Parameters are what goes inside the parenthesis when you * write* the method.

## Trigonometric Methods

Trig functions will not be on the exams in this course because Trig is not a prerequisite.  

If you do need the Trig functions, remember that the trig functions take arguments in radians, not degrees.

## Exponent Methods

## Rounding Methods

## Min, Max, and Abs

## Random 

## Character Data

The data type char uses 'single quote' marks.  Character data is different than String data.

In effect Java treats character data more like integers than strings.

### ASCII

### Unicode

### Escape Sequences

### Comparing and testing char data

## String

Strings are a class, not a "primitive" data types.

### charAt

### Concatenating Strings

### Converting strings

### Comparing Strings

### Substrings

## Converting between numbers and strings

## Formatting console output
