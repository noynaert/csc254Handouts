\textbf{Grading}

Your answers must be hand-written on printed copies of the notes.  
\begin{itemize}
 
    \item This document will only be "spot checked."  Not all answers may be graded.
    \item \textit{Don't skip questions!} If you don't know an answer, at least give it a try.  Or explain what you don't understand.  Put a big star or arrow around the points you don't understand and ask about them in class.
    \item Keep your copy.  When I make up the test I will go down the notes page and draw inspiration from these questions when making up the exam. These notes pages will be good study guides.
    \item You may write any lingering questions or muddy points at the end of the document.  Then ask in class
    \item Scan this document into a .pdf file and turn it in.  If you don't have access to a regular scanner then install a "CamScanner" app on your phone or tablet.  They work pretty well.  Photographs will not be accepted.  You must scan to a .pdf document.
\end{itemize}
