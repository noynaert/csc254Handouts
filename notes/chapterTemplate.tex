\textbf{Grading}

Your answers must be hand-written on printed copies of the notes.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item I will not accept typed answers
    \item I will not accept answers written on notebook paper.
    \item This document will only be "spot checked."  Not all answers may be graded.
    \item \textit{Don't skip questions!} If you don't know an answer, at least give it a try.  Or explain what you don't understand.  Put a big star or arrow around the points you don't understand and ask about them in class.
    \item Keep your copy.  When I make up the test I will go down the notes page and draw inspiration from these questions when making up the exam. These notes pages will be good study guides.
    \item You may write any lingering questions or muddy points at the end of the document.  Then ask in class
    \item Scan this document into a .pdf file and turn it in.  If you don't have access to a regular scanner then install a "CamScanner" app on your phone or tablet.  They work pretty well.  Photographs will not be accepted.  You must scan to a .pdf document.
\end{itemize}

\textit{\textbf{Video 02.010 Part 1}}

\begin{questions}
\question What symbol is used for a line comment? \makebox[4em]{\hrulefill}

\begin{samepage}
\question What are the Java operators for each of the following?
\begin{itemize}
  \item \makebox[2em]{\hrulefill}   addition 
  \item \makebox[2em]{\hrulefill}    subtraction
  \item \makebox[2em]{\hrulefill}    multiplication
  \item \makebox[2em]{\hrulefill}    division
  \item \makebox[2em]{\hrulefill}   modulo (finding the remainder
\end{itemize}

\textit{\textbf{Video 02.020 IDs}}

 \question Why is naming things difficult?  What are the characteristics of a "good" name versus a "bad" name?
 \vspace{1.5cm}
 
  
 \begin{samepage}
 \question What are the four syntax rules listed in the video?
 \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
  \end{itemize}
 \end{samepage}
 \question What characters may appear as the first character of an id?

 \begin{samepage}
    \rule{1.\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\textit{The next couple of questions are not really discussed in the video.  Perhaps I should have.  But think about them and come up with an answer.}

 \question A single character may be an id.  Digits are not allowed as the first character of an id. What problems could come up if this was allowed.  A sample of some possible code is listed below
 \begin{verbatim}
    double x = 5.0;
    double 3 = 4.0;
    x = 3;
 \end{verbatim} 
 \question A dash or hyphen may not appear as part of an id.   What problems could come up if this was allowed.  A sample of some possible code is listed below
 \begin{verbatim}
    double amount = 100.00;
    double sales-tax = 0.07;
    double price = amount * sales-tax;
 \end{verbatim} 
\end{samepage}

\rule{1.0\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\question Look through the list of reserved words.  We have already used some reserved words in class as we were writing programs.  

\begin{samepage}
\question A lot of words that seem like they \textit{should be} reserved words, but they are not.  In the following code circle all of the words that start with a letter but which are \textbf{\textit{not}} key words.

\begin{verbatim}
    public class Thing{

        public static void main(String[] args){
            
            double x = 0.0;

            System.out.println(Math.PI);
        }
    }
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}
\question What does "case sensitive" mean?  Are Java ids case sensitive?
%\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{0.3\textwidth}
%    \centering
%\includegraphics{100camel.png}
%\end{figure}
%\end{wrapfigure}
\question What is "camelCase?"  Give an example.

\question What is the style guideline for class names?
\question Why is the style guideline for named constants?
\question Should you abbreviate?  Why or why not?
\question \$ and \_ are allowed to start Java variables.  Why shouldn't you declare variables of these types?
\question What does "Self Documenting Code" mean?
\question Both camelCase and underscore are useful when joining two words together into a single ID.  When does Java usually use camelCase and when does it usually use underscores?
\end{questions}
