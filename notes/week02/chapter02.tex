\textbf{Grading}

Your answers must be hand-written on printed copies of the notes.  
\begin{itemize}
    \item I will not accept typed answers
    \item I will not accept answers written on notebook paper.
    \item This document will only be "spot checked."  Not all answers may be graded.
    \item \textit{Don't skip questions!} If you don't know an answer, at least give it a try.  Or explain what you don't understand.  Put a big star or arrow around the points you don't understand and ask about them in class.
    \item Keep your copy.  When I make up the test I will go down the notes page and draw inspiration from these questions when making up the exam. These notes pages will be good study guides.
    \item You may write any lingering questions or muddy points at the end of the document.  Then ask in class
    \item Scan this document into a .pdf file and turn it in.  If you don't have access to a regular scanner then install a "CamScanner" app on your phone or tablet.  They work pretty well.  Photographs will not be accepted.  You must scan to a .pdf document.

 \begin{samepage}
    \rule{1.\textwidth}{0.4pt}

\textit{The next couple of questions are not really discussed in the video.  Perhaps I should have.  But think about them and come up with an answer.}

 \question A single character may be an id.  Digits are not allowed as the first character of an id. What problems could come up if this was allowed.  A sample of some possible code is listed below

    double x = 5.0;
    double 3 = 4.0;
    x = 3;
 \end{verbatim} 
 \question A dash or hyphen may not appear as part of an id.   What problems could come up if this was allowed.  A sample of some possible code is listed below

    double amount = 100.00;
    double sales-tax = 0.07;
    double price = amount * sales-tax;
 \end{verbatim}

\rule{1.0\textwidth}{0.4pt}
\question Look through the list of reserved words.  We have already used some reserved words in class as we were writing programs.  

\begin{samepage}
\question A lot of words that seem like they \textit{should be} reserved words, but they are not.  In the following code circle all of the words that start with a letter but which are \textbf{\textit{not}} key words.

\begin{verbatim}
    public class Thing{

        public static void main(String[] args){
            
            double x = 0.0;

            System.out.println(Math.PI);
        }

%\end{wrapfigure}
\question What is "camelCase?"  Give an example.

\question What is the style guideline for class names?

\question Should you abbreviate?  Why or why not?\\

\begin{samepage}
\question  For each of the following, write + in front of an id if it follows both the syntax and style rules.  Put a 0 next to it if it follows the syntax, but not the style rules for user-created variables.  Put a - sign next to variables that violate the syntax rules.  Assume each is a variable.  If it would be a good name for a class then write "Class" next to it.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  name 
  \item  Name 
  \item  price 
  \item  price 
  \item  export
  \item  wrkHrs

      double x = 8
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}
\question If you don't initialize a variable, what value is stored in the variable?
\question If you have a number over 3 billion, can the number be stored in a double?
\question How many digits of accuracy may be represented as a double?
\question What would the equivalent be the "normal" decimal value of $1.23 x 10^4$
\question Write 1.23e105 in Scientific Notation.
\question What is the largest double value (approximately).  Would you prefer to write this number out in regular notation or would you rather write it in scientific notation?
\question In what situations do doubles cause some problems when doing calculations?

\question What is the largest possible value for an integer (to the nearest billion)?
\question Why is String capitalized, but double and int are not capitalized?
\question How is String data represented differently than numeric data in Java?
\vspace{1cm}
\question This is not explicitly covered in the video, but you should be able to reason it out if you think about it.  

In Java, two integers may be compared as \texttt{(5 == 2+3)}.  What would be the problem with comparing string data such as \texttt{("Bob" == "Bo"+"b")}?
\vspace{1cm}
\question What types of values could a boolean variable hold?
\question If you do not initialize a boolean variable, what value would it be set to (this question may be out of sequence.  Remember that Java defaults to a "zero-ish" value.)
\begin{samepage}
\question What would be printed by each of the following?  (Try each statement out in IntelliJ if you are not sure of the answer).  The last one was not done in the video.  Think about it.  Then try it.  The last question is really just an effort to force you to experiment on your own.
\begin{verbatim}
    System.out.println(3.14 / 0.);

    System.out.println(Math.PI / -0.);
    
    System.out.println(Math.sqrt(-1.));
    
    System.out.println(Infinity - 1.0);

    System.out.println(Math.log(Math.E));

\question What constructor will we use to read from a file?
\question What is the difference between a "method" and a "function?"
\begin{samepage}
\question What data type is returned by each of the following?  These are not answered at this point in the video.  Use the API website to figure out the types that are returned.

  \item nextDouble() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
  \item nextInt() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
  \item next() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}

    7.143  0202
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}
\question What happens if a the user hits the Enter key or blank space when the Scanner is trying to read a number from the keyboard?
\question What happens if the user types a number with two decimal points.  Perhaps something like 12.34.56 when the Scanner is trying to read a double (The video never does this, but you can probably guess.  Also, you should be running a playground-type program running in IntelliJ so you should be able to confirm your answer.)
\question An exception has occurred.  
\begin{samepage}
\question Suppose Intellij produces the following error.  What type of exception occured?  What line number did the exception happen in?
\begin{verbatim}
  Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939)
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594)
