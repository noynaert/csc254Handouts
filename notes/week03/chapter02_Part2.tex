\textbf{Grading}

Your answers must be hand-written on printed copies of the notes.  
\begin{itemize}
 
    \item This document will only be "spot checked."  Not all answers may be graded.
    \item \textit{Don't skip questions!} If you don't know an answer, at least give it a try.  Or explain what you don't understand.  Put a big star or arrow around the points you don't understand and ask about them in class.
    \item Keep your copy.  When I make up the test I will go down the notes page and draw inspiration from these questions when making up the exam. These notes pages will be good study guides.
    \item You may write any lingering questions or muddy points at the end of the document.  Then ask in class
    \item Scan this document into a .pdf file and turn it in.  If you don't have access to a regular scanner then install a "CamScanner" app on your phone or tablet.  They work pretty well.  Photographs will not be accepted.  You must scan to a .pdf document.
\end{itemize}

\begin{questions}
    \question What import do you have to do to use the Scanner class?
    \question What is the URL for the java API?  I used version 17 in the video.  Give the URL for the version of Java that you are using.
    \question What constructor would we use if we want to read from a file?
    \question What constructor will we use to read from a file?
    \question What is the difference between a "method" and a "function?"
    \begin{samepage}
    \question What data type is returned by each of the following?  These are not answered at this point in the video.  Use the API website to figure out the types that are returned.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item nextDouble() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
      \item nextInt() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
      \item next() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
      \item nextLine() returns a \makebox[2in]{\hrulefill}
    \end{itemize}
    \end{samepage}

\question Do you have to use the id "keyboard" when reading from the keyboard?  Explain your answer.
\vspace{1cm}
\question What is the name of the InputStream used when reading from the keyboard.  (Hint:  The answer is not System.out)

\question What command would close a stream.  Assume the Scanner is called "input."
\begin{samepage}
\question what is the line of code that would be needed to do the following task?
\begin{verbatim}
  Read a double from the keyboard into a variable named x;
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}
\begin{samepage}
\question Given the above statement that reads a variable into x, what would happen if the user typed the following input.  
\begin{verbatim}
    7.143  0202
\end{verbatim}
\end{samepage}
\question What happens if a the user hits the Enter key or blank space when the Scanner is trying to read a number from the keyboard?
\question What happens if the user types a number with two decimal points.  Perhaps something like 12.34.56 when the Scanner is trying to read a double (The video never does this, but you can probably guess.  Also, you should be running a playground-type program running in IntelliJ so you should be able to confirm your answer.)
\question An exception has occurred.  
\begin{samepage}
\question Suppose Intellij produces the following error.  What type of exception occured?  What line number did the exception happen in?
\begin{verbatim}
  Exception in thread "main" java.util.InputMismatchException
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.throwFor(Scanner.java:939)
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.next(Scanner.java:1594)
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2258)
	at java.base/java.util.Scanner.nextInt(Scanner.java:2212)
	at App.main(App.java:16)
\end{verbatim}
  What is the name of the exception?\\
  In your program, what line number generated the error?
\end{samepage}
\question What is the difference between next() and nextLine()?
\vspace{1cm}
\question What happens if you use next() to read from the keyboard, and the user types a number?
\question Write a complete program that prompts a user for an integer and reads it from the keyboard.  It should also read a string from the keyboard. Include the necessary import  You do NOT need to include the /**javadoc*/ comment.
