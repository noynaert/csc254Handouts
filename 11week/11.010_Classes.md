# 11.010 About Classes

A class is often referred to as the logical equivalent of a blueprint.  A class has attributes or data fields.  It also has methods.

We will be focusing on "POJOs."  A POJO is a "Plain Old Java Object."  A POJO often represents an object in the real world.

POJO is an informal concept.  In this class we will consider a POJO to have the following characteristics

* Data fields are `private`
* There is a constructor, usually for all fields
* Every field has a getter and a setter
* The object can print itself with a toString() method.
