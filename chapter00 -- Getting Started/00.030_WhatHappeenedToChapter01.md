#00.030 What happened to Chapter 01?

Chapter 01 is a time bandit.  It can take 3 weeks to cover the material.  But many students don't have the background to understand some of the material, so it is pointless to cover it at the start of the class.  Most of the material in Chapter 01 will be spread through the rest of the course.
