# 04.015 Danger Zones

There are quite a few subtle things that can cause comparisons to give some surprising results.  This unit will look at two big ones.

## Floading point equality

This section applies to both `float` and `double` data types.

You have to be very careful about doing == and != operations on floating point numbers.  

For example, in everyday practice, 1.5 + 1.5 is .3.   And also, .1 + .2 is also equal to .3.  So it is common sense that the following expression should be true.

```java
       .15 + .15 == .1 + .2
```
However, if you run the following you will see why the above expression prints out as false:

```java
          System.out.printf("%1.17f %1.17f\n", .15 + .15, .1 + .2);
```

This produces the following output:

```txt
    0.30000000000000000 0.30000000000000004
```

They are only off by .00000000000000004 but that is enough to make them not equal.

There are a couple of ways to handle floating point operations.  One method is to only do >, &lt;, &lt;= and >=.

There is another commonly used method that will be discussed in the next chapter because they involve use of math functions.

## String Comparison

There are a lot of situations where it is necessary to compare two strings to each other.  For this chapter, don't do string comparisons.  Syntactically it is possible to use the operators like  "Abe" &lt; "Bob."  But it will not give the results  you are most likely expecting.

We will look at String comparisons in another chapter.
