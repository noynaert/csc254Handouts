## 04.060 Conditional Operator

The *Conditional Operator* is also known as the *Ternary Operator*

***Only use the conditional operator when it returns a value.***  Do not use it just as a replacement for an if/then/else.

```java
if(y != 0.0){
    z = x/y;
}else{
    z = 999.999
}
```

```java
z = (y!=0.0) ? x/y : 999.999;
```

Parenthesis around conditional is not required, but it does improve readability in most situations.
