# 04.050 Switch Statement

## Basic Switch

Later version of Java have advanced switch features.  The textbook only covers the basic switch.

```java
int day = 3;
switch(day){
    case 1:  System.out.println("Monday");
             break;
    case 2:  System.out.println("Tuesday");
             break;
    case 3:  System.out.println("Wednesday");
             break;
    case 4:  System.out.println("Thursday");
             break;
    case 5:  System.out.println("Friday");
             break;
    case 6:  System.out.println("Saturday");
             break;
    case 0:
    case 7:  System.out.println("Sunday");
             break;
    default:
             System.out.prinf("The value %d is unknown\n",day)
}
```

The break; statement is needed.  Without it, the code "falls through" to the next case.

To see a practical use of this feature, see `case 0:` and `case 7:`.  If the day is set to 0 then the code falls through.

General syntax:

```text
switch(STATUS){
    case INTEGER_VALUE:
         STATEMENT(S);
         break;
    case INTEGER_VALUE:
         STATEMENTS
         break;
    default:  //optional
         STATEMENTS //OPTIONAL
}
```

The switch status and cases must be an integer type.  That does include char as well as int, byte, short, long.  It also includes some additional advanced types like Integer and enum.

```java
char letter ='h';

switch(letter){
    case 'a':
    case 'e':
    case 'i':
    case 'o':
    case 'u': 
                System.out.printf("%c is a vowel\n", vowel);
                break;
    case 'y':   System.out.println("Sometimes y is a vowel, and sometimes it is not.");
    default:    System.out.printf("%c is not a vowel",vowel)
}
```

## Advanced stuff that will not be on the exam

```text
enum NEW DATA TYPE{
    VALUE1,
    VALUE2,
    VALUE3
}

```

### Actual Java

```java
enum Months{
    JANUARY,
    FEBRUARY,
    MARCH,
    APRIL,
    MAY,
    JUNE,
    JULY,
    AUGUST,
    SEPTEMBER,
    OCTOBER,
    NOVEMBER,
    DECEMBER,
}

Month month = JANUARY;

switch(month){
case DECEMBER:
case JANUARY: 
case FEBRUARY:
                System.out.println("Winter");
                break;
    ...
}
```
