# 04.040 Nested If Statements

If statements may be "nested" inside other if statements.  

## Syntax

The main syntax rule is that the entire if statement must be entirely contained inside either the if condition or the else condition.

This is also true in Python and most computer languages.  Python enforces the requirement with indentation.  Java enforces the requirement with curly braces.

```
if( .... ){
    if( ... ){

    }else{

    }
}else{
    if( ... ){

    }else{

    }
}  
```
## An Example

Assume that to join a certain club you must be at least 18 years old.  Senior citizens get a 10% discount on their membership fee.

```java
if(age >= 18){
    System.out.println("You are eligible to join our club.");
    if(age >= 65){
        System.out.println("You qualify for a 10% discount on your membership");
        System.out.println("Your annual membership is $90.00");
     }else{
        System.out.println("Your annual membership is $100.00");
     }
    }
}else{
    System.out.println("You do not qualify for membership.");
}
```

## A Subtle Problem

Let up suppose that we didn't want to print the amount of the membership fee.  Then we could eliminate the statement about the $100.00 membership fee.  It would be tempting just to delete the else.

```java
if(age >= 18){
    System.out.println("You are eligible to join our club.");
    if(age >= 65){
        System.out.println("You qualify for a 10% discount on your membership");
     }
}else{
   System.out.println("You do not qualify for membership.");
}
```

The above code works properly because the curly braces below the else make it clear 

The above block of code looks correct, but the indentation does not match the Java logic.  If it was indented properly it would look like this:

```java
if(age >= 18){
    System.out.println("You are eligible to join our club.");
    if(age >= 65){
        System.out.println("You qualify for a 10% discount on your membership");
     }  //this } is important.  So is the one on the next line.
}else{
   System.out.println("You do not qualify for membership.");
}
```

But if there is a single statement in the "then" or "else" parts of the if statement, then we technically do not need to have the curly braces.  But if we remove the curly braces there is a problem.

The code is now visually misleading:

```java
if(age >= 18)
    System.out.println("You are eligible to join our club.");
    if(age >= 65)
        System.out.println("You qualify for a 10% discount on your membership");
else
   System.out.println("You do not qualify for membership.");
```

But the else now attaches itself to the last open if statement.  So logically it works like this:

```java
if(age >= 18)
    System.out.println("You are eligible to join our club.");
    if(age >= 65)
        System.out.println("You qualify for a 10% discount on your membership");
    else
        System.out.println("You do not qualify for membership.");
```

There are a couple of lessons here.  One of them is to use curly braces, even if they are not needed.  The other is to use the "reformat" option available in most IDEs.  The IDE will attempt to format the code according to how the code will actually work.  This sometimes reveals logic errors.
