# 03.050 jshell and some Java Statements

* jshell is like interactive mode in Python.
* Only available in later versions of Java
* Not for complete programs, but it is good for trying things.
* Lets us skip over technical parts needed for a regular program
* **Type ```/exit``` to quit the jshell```.  This is important to remember

## Start and exit the jshell

Start by typing ```jshell``` at the command line. (That is, in a terminal)

Exit by typing ```/exit```

## Declare a variable and give it a value

To declare an integer, use ```int```

To declare a real number use ```double```

You can use the ```=``` symbol to give the variable an initial value.  Read the = sign as "Takes on the value of."  Do not read = sign as "equals"

Variables may be reused without declaring them again.
