# 03.003 Newlines, Print, and Println

## `print` vs `println`

So far we have had two output statements.  Both of them just printed a String.  Numbers could be printed, but we did not have much control over their format.

* System.out.println();
* System.out.print();

System.out.print does *not* print a newline character at the end of the line.

## The newline `\n` character

The newline characters is `'\n'`

I am talking about the character, so I used single quotes. A newline String would be in double quotes like this `"\n"`. 

The newline starts a new line wherever it occurs.

```java
String s = "The Good\nThe Bad\nThe Ugly";
System.out.print(s);
```

Produces

```text
The Good
The Bad
The Ugly
```

### Newline in Output statements

You may append "\n" to the end of a string in System.out.print to simulate a println.

If you append "\n" at the end of System.out.println string you effectively double space

## Println without an argument

Doing `System.out.println()` with no argument produces a newline

### Complex String Concatenations

```java
        final double INCHES_PER_CENTIMETER = 0.393701;
        double inches;
        double centimeters = 10.0;

        inches = centimeters / INCHES_PER_CENTIMETER;

        System.out.println(INCHES_PER_CENTIMETER);
        System.out.println("Inches Per Centimeter: " + INCHES_PER_CENTIMETER);

        System.out.println(centimeters + " centimeters is " + inches + " inches.");
```

Produces 

```text
Inches Per Centimeter: 0.393701
10.0 centimeters is 25.399986284007404 inches.
```
