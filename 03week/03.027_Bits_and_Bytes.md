# Signed vs Unsigned numbers

If you have 8 bits you may have 256 different values.  For numeric data we have two options

bits|~~Unsigned~~|Signed
:---:|:---:|:---:
8| ~~0 through 255~~|-128 through 127
16| ~~0 through 65,536~~|-32,768 through 32,767
32|~~0 through 4 billion~~|-2 billion through 2 billion

## Byte 

A group of 8 bits is 1 byte on modern computers.
