# 03.010 Named Constants

Constants are declared by putting "final" in front of data type id and assigning a value.

Final is an example of a "modifier."  Modifiers are placed before the data type and change how the item is accessed or used.

The value of a final value may not be changed.

Right now we are only using "final" for *Named Constants.* Later we will see that final may also be applied to methods and classes.

## Style

By tradition finals are in all caps.

## Examples

```
final int MINIMUM_VALUE = 5;
final double SHORT_PI = 3.14;
final char PERIOD = ' ';
final String OFFICIAL_NAME = "Missouri Western State University";
```
