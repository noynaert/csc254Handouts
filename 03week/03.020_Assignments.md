# 03.020 Assignments

***Assignments are not equations!***

```
x = x + 1
```

The above statement is not valid in Mathematics because the is no value of x that would make the statement true.

However, it is valid in Java.  It means add one to x, and then assign that value to x.  In effect it increases the value of x by one.

Do not read the = sign as "equals."  Read it as "takes on the value of." 

```
x takes on the value of x + 1
```

## Structure and operation of assignment statements.

There must be a lone variable immediately to the left of the = sign.  

The value to the right of the = sign must be an expression that returns a value that may be assigned to the data type of the variable on the left.

The first thing that happens is the expression on the right is evaluated.

After the value of the expression is computed, then it is assigned to the value on the left.

```
int i = 7;
int j = 7 + i;
i = j + 7
```

Why would the following cause an error?

```
int i = 3 * 3.14159;
```

## Special assignment operators

There are some operators that are shortcuts for common operations.  I expect you to be able to recognize these statements, but you do not need to use them at every opportunity.

`+=` is a shortcut

<hr>


```
String greeting = "Hello, ";
greeting = greeting + name;
```
The above may be written as 

```
String greeting = "Hello, ";
greeting += name;
```

<hr>

There are shortcuts for the other numeric and String operators

Shortcut|Long Expression|Short version
:---:|:---|:---
`-=`|n = n - 3|n -= 3
`*=`|r = r * Math.PI| r *= Math.PI
`/=`|x = x / 3.0 |x /= 3.0
`%=`|n = n % MAXIMUM| n %= MAXIMUM
