# 10.030 Splitting Strings

Strings may be split into arrays.

[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String))

Look at the definition of the `split` method:

```text
public String[] splitâ€‹(String regex)
```

Notice that the return type is `String[]`.  That means the split method returns an array of Strings.

## regex

The formal parameter is "regex."  Regex is a pattern to be matched.  Regex patterns can get very complex.  Don't freak out about them.

The simplest regex pattern is just a symbol in double quotes.  The formal argument specifies the pattern that is used to separate the shorter strings in the longer strings.

A blank space is the most common regex character.  It works to separate words.  So the following line would yield 5 strings in the array.

```java
String line = "Sheldon Cooper Penny Leonard Hofstadter"
String[] words = line.spit(" ");
```
However, maybe the blank spaces are significant.  Therefore we might want to use a different delimimiter, such as the "pipe" symbol.

```java
String line = "Sheldon Cooper|Penny|Leonard Hofstadter"
String[] people = line.spit("|");
```

You may use any character as a delimiter, but ideally you want to pick a delimiter that will not show up in the text itself.

The  tab character "\t" is often a useful delimiter, especially when working with data exported from spreadsheets.  Most Spreadsheets export data in "tab delimited" format.
