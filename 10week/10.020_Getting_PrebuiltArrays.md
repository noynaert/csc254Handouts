# 10.020 Getting Pre Built Arrays

Students often stress over the syntax of declaring arrays.  Instructors and textbook authors often stress over methods to put data in arrays.  But there are sometimes arrays that Java gives us.

```java
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
```

## Finding the length of args

```java
System.out.println("The length of the args[] array is " + args.length );
```

## Where do the args come from?

These would normally come from the command line.

In IntelliJ you can simulate command line arguments.  You can edit the run-time configuration to add the simulated command line arguments.

## Getting the contents of args

* Subscripts are used to access the items in the array
* Subscripts start at zero
* Subscripts go up to (length-1)
* Subscripts out of range cause an error (actually, an Exception)
  * Note that an integer equal to length will give an error.
* Subscripts are enclosed in[square braces]
* Subscripts must be an an integer type. Usually they are int

## `n` and `length`

In the case of args, `n` is the length of the array. 

Normally, you would not create a separate n in this case. 

### A for loop

```java
int n = args.length;
for(int i=0; i < n; i++){
    System.out.printf("[%d] is %s\n", i, args[i]);
}
```
