# 10.010 About Arrays

Arrays are collections of data.

* Java arrays may hold either primitive types or objects.
* All entries in a Java array must be of the same type.
  * Videos of a primitive type may only contain that type of primitive type.
  * Arrays in Java are indexed from 0.
  * Arrays of objects must be of the same class.  However, in many cases Java inheritance makes some special cases possible.
    * Strings are objects, but due to a unique feature of Strings, array Strings must only hold Strings.  Arrays of class Object may also include Strings.  Don't worry about this too much right now.
  * In Java, arrays are declared with a fixed size
  * In Java, copying an array can be tricky.  It is at least non-trivial.

## One big thing to keep in mind.

Array size and the number of items in an array are different.  The number of items in an array is often represented as the variable `n`.

## What is the array variable itself?

The array name is a variable.  It contains the ***address where the array is located***

This becomes very important.  Soon.
