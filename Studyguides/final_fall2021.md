# Study Guide CSC 254
## Final Exam, Fall 2021

* The exam will be on Thursday, December 16	10:30 a.m. â€“ 12:30 p.m.
* The exam will be closed book.
* The majority of the exam will be objective questions.  
* You will be expected to write code for part of the exam.  You should be able to write the following:
  * A public class including
    * Extending an existing class
    * Implementing the `Comparable<...>` Interface
    * Constructors (including a default constructor)
    * Setters and Getters for the private fields
    * `toString`
    * `compareTo` (using simple string and/or integer comparisons)
    * A specialized method relevant to that class.
    * You will ***not*** need to implement `hashcode` and `equals` methods.  But you should know what they do and how they may be generated in VS Code

I suggest you try to answer the questions while sitting at a computer.  That way you can try things out with a little program.

For the checkpoint questions in the tables below, the page number is the starting page number.  In many cases the problems flow onto the next page.

## Chapter 4, Math functions, characters, strings

Page|Checkpoint|Notes
:---:|:---|:---
126|4.2.1|The functions that you should know are `sqrt`,`pow`,`round`,`floor`,`ceil`, and `random` (Random isn't in this section) 
&nbsp;|~~4.2.2 - 2.2.7~~|(skip) Most of these are trig-related
130|4.3.1 - 4.3.2|&nbsp;
&nbsp;|~~4.3.3 - 4.3.8~~|(skip)
138|4.4.1 - 4.4.2|This is a large and important section.  On question 4.4.2 it is important to know why you should not do statements such as `s1 == s2` and `s1 >= s2`
&nbsp;|~~4.4.3 - 4.4.4~~|(skip)
&nbsp;|4.4.5|&nbsp;
&nbsp;|~~4.4.6 - 4.4.7~~|(skip)

## Chapter 5, Loops

Page|Checkpoint|Notes
:---:|:---|:---
163|5.2.1 - 5.2.3|&nbsp
166|5.3.1|
168|~~5.4.1~~|(skip) I wish we had done this.  You might want to skim through this section for future reference.
170|5.5.1|
172|5.6.1 - 5.6.2|  ***Also, what is the difference between a `while` loop and a `for` loop?***  What is the general guide for when to use a for loop and when to use a while loop?
175|5.7.1 - 5.7.7|You may want to run a little program to test the results.
177|5.8.1 - 5.8.4|
179|5.9.1 - 5.9.2| 
186|~~5.11.1 - 5.11.5~~|(skip)
188|5.12.1 - 5.12.4| I am including these because you should know how the `break` and `continue` statements work.  Just remember that they are evil.  Why are they evil?

## Chapter 6, Methods

Page|Checkpoint|Notes
:---:|:---|:---
206|6.1.1|And important question!
208|6.2.1 - 6.2.2|
