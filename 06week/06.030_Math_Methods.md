## Calculating nth roots.

There is a cube root function, `cbrt()`.  It isn't on the list of the That covers $\sqrt[2]{x}$.  The cbrt() method covers $\sqrt[3]{x}$.  But what about arbitrary bases like $\sqrt[n]{x}$?

The pow() function saves the day.  The value of $\sqrt[n]{x}$ May be expressed as `pow(x,1.0/n)`.  

In the expression `pow(x,1.0/n)` it is likely that n is an int.  Why is it important that  the formula uses 1.0 instead of 1.

## Trig functions

Trig is not a prerequisite for this course, so you do not need to know the Trig functions.  If you understand the trig functions, note that the arguments must be radians.
