# 08.050 `for` loop

```
for(________;________;________)
     //body
```

* The first blank initializes the "loop index"
* The second blank is a test that is run *after* each pass through the loop
* The third blank is the update of the loop index.  It runs after every pass through the loop.

```java
for(int i=0; i<10; i++){
    System.out.println("i is now "+i)
}
```

## For is a pretest loop.

It is possible to skip the body

```java
start = 6;
stop = 3;
for(int i=start; i<stop; i+=2){
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

## Unwritten rules for for loops

* The loop index should be an integer
* Use a for loop only if the program can detect how many times the loop will execute *before* the loop starts.
* i, j, and k almost always mean the index of a loop.  Don't use them elsewhere.

## Slight modification of the scoping rules

The index may be declared outside the loop.  If it is declared outside the loop it is just like any other index.

However, if the index is declared in the initializer, then it is limited to the loop.  This is useful because you may use the same index if you have multiple independent loops.

## Any of the three fields may be blank. 

Any of the fields may be blank.  In that case just include the ;

```java
int i = 0;
```

## Nested for

```java
for(int i = 0;i < 10;i++){
    for(int j = 10; j >= 0; j--){
      System.out.printf("%2d x %2d = %3d\n",i, j, i*j);
    }
}
```
