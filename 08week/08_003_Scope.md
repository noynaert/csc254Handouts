# 01.030 Scope

A block is the lines of code within {curly braces}.

*Scope* is the area where a variable is available for use.  In general, a variable is available inside the curly braces where it is declared.  It is also available inside any blocks within the block where the variable is declared.

In the above, note that line and number are declared outside the {} of the try and catch clauses.  If they were declared inside the { } they would not be available to the parts of the program outside of the curly braces.  

```java
if(...){
    int i = 7;
    if(...){
        int j = 3;
        int k = 0;
        System.out.println(i + " " j); //This is OK.  Both `i` and `j` are in scope
    }
    if(...){
        int j = 99;  //This is OK, because it is in a different scope than the previous j.
            // k is not available here, but I is.  The local `j with a value of 99 is available, but not the one with a value of 3
    }    
}
```
