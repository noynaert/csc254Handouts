# 08.060 While Loop

```
while(boolean expression)
  //body
```

The syntax is relatively simple.

* The loop begins with a `while` reserved word.
* There must be a boolean expression in parenthesis.
* The body may be a single statement or a block of statements in parenthesis.
* Warning:  Don't put a ; right after the boolean expression.

## While is a pretest loop

It is possible to skip the body.

```java
        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
        String answer;
        char ch;

        //set up for first test
        System.out.print("Would you like to see a random number? (y or n) ");
        answer = input.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
        ch = answer.charAt(0);
        while(ch == 'y' ){
            //do the main processing of the loop
            double number = Math.random();
            System.out.println("A random number: " + number);


            System.out.print("Would you like to see another random number? (y or n) ");
            answer = input.nextLine().trim().toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT);
            ch = answer.charAt(0);
        }
```

## Loop logic

The design pattern used to set up the loop is as important as the syntax.  

### Sentinel Controlled loop.

![Sentinel guarding a gate](sentinel.jpg)

The initial loop shown is controlled by the user typing a "sentinel value" that is controlled by the loop.

The logic looks upside down.

* There must be a "setup" before the loop starts.
* Processing is done at the top of the loop
* There must be a "reset" operation at the bottom of the loop to prepare for the next pass through the loop.
  * Very often the reset operation is identical or similar to the setup for the first test.

### Loop Invariants

A loop invariant is a condition that has the following properties

* The condition is true immediately before the first test of the loop.
* The condition is true at the end of the body of the loop (and before the subsequent re-test of the loop condition)
* The condition is true immediately after the loop ends execution (immediately after the test fails)
