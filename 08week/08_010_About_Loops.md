# 08.010 About Loops

Java has various types of loops.  In this chapter we will be covering three types of loops.

We will also take a couple of little side tracks

* chaining method calls
* Reading from files


## Many types of loops

* `while`
* `do{ }while`
* `for`

In theory, we only need one type of loop.  Anything that may be written with a `do{}while` or `for` loop would could be written with just a `while` loop.  

* The other types of loops offer convenience to the programmer.  
* The use of the other types of loops can make the program more readable
* The use of the other types of loops can help avoid programming errors

## Programming Patterns

There are some types of operations that are very common.  "Patterns" are standard ways of doing things.  Knowing the common patterns speeds up programming, and it can also reduce programming errors.

When learning the loops you need to learn both the syntax and the patterns.

## The `while` loop is the generic workhorse

The `while` loop is the most basic form of the loop.  It has several different uses.  For example, it may be used as a counting loop or a sentinel loop.  It may also be used to read data from a file until the end of file is encountered.

It is important to learn to use the various patterns that are commonly used with the for loop.

## Which type should you use?

As previously mentioned, there are three types of loops covered in this chapter.  Java actually has some others, including variations on the `for` loop.

One important thing is learning when it is appropriate to use each type of loop.

The bottom line is that just learning the syntax is not enough.  It is also important to understand the proper use.
