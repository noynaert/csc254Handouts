# 02.030 Variables

Variables hold a value.  The contents of a variable may change.

Variables are assigned a name.  The name is an Id and it must follow the rules for ids.

Variable ids should start with a lower case letter

Variable ids should generally be a noun or noun phrase.

```
jshell> double radius = 1.0
radius ==> 1.0

jshell> double area
area ==> 0.0

jshell> area = radius * radius * Math.PI
area ==> 3.141592653589793

jshell> radius = 2.2
radius ==> 2.2

jshell> area = radius * radius * Math.PI
area ==> 15.205308443374602
```

## Variables must be declared

Variables must be declared before they are used the first time.

## Data Types

Variables must have a type.

Newer versions of Java allow a generic type declaration of ```var```, but you should not use it yet.

There are a lot of data types, and later in this course you will learn to create even more data types.  But for now we will use the following data types:

Data Type | Explanation | Examples|Maximum Value
---|---|---|---
double|Numbers with a decimal point| 5.2, -7.6, 1.3E4|1.7976931348623157 x 10<sup>308</sup> <br>About 15 or 16 digits of precision
int | Integers | 1, 0, -7|2,147,483,647 (2 billion)
String|groups of characters| "Hello", "1776"|
boolean|True or False|true, false, 5 < 6|

### double

Doubles are real numbers expressed as a decimal value.  

Doubles may be written in scientific notation.  For example 1.3 x 10<sup>4</sup> would be written 1.3E4

```
jshell> double x
x ==> 0.0

jshell> x = 5.6789 / .000000000005
x ==> 1.13578E12
```

#### Some special double values

Value | Explanation
---|---
&nbsp;Infinity | Dividing a positive number by 0.0 gives Infinity
-Infinity | Dividing a negative number by 0.0 gives -Infinity
+0 and -0 | (I suspect these mainly exist to make the Mathemaaticians mad.)
&nbsp;NaN | Not a Number.  Taking the square root of a negative number is one way to generate a NaN.

The special values may not be on the right side of the assignment operator =

```
jshell> double x
x ==> 0.0

jshell> x = 55.3 / 0.0
x ==> Infinity

jshell> x = -33.0 / 0.0
x ==> -Infinity

jshell> x = Math.sqrt(49.)
x ==> 7.0

jshell> x = Math.sqrt( -3.14 )
x ==> NaN

x = Infinity + 1.0
|  Error:
|  cannot find symbol
|    symbol:   variable Infinity
|  x = Infinity + 1.0
|      ^------^
